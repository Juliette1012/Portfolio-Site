It's a write-up about the room : [Try Hack Me - Room : Jupyter 100](https://tryhackme.com/room/jupyter101)

# [Task 1] Preface

![Task 1](/media/thm/jupyter-101/task-1.png)

# [Task 2] What is Jupyter ?

> Jupyter is a web-based platform often used for data analytics / plotting, machine learning, where code is stored in "Notebooks" whom can imported/exported and shared in many formats such as LaTex, HTML, PDF and many more!

# [Task 3] Deploying Instance & Logging In

After deploying the instance, we have :
![Deploy](/media/thm/jupyter-101/deploy.png)

We have to go on the website of the IP adress and connect with the password `tryhackme`.

![Password](/media/thm/jupyter-101/password.png)

Once connect : ![Menu](/media/thm/jupyter-101/menu.png)

# [Task 4] Let's Learn More About Jupyter 

> Enter the "WhatIsJupyter" directory and launch "WhatIsJupyter.ipynb" and have a read through.

# [Task 5] Understanding how Jupyter Notebooks Run

> Navigate into the "UnderstandingJupyterNotebooks" directory and launch "UnderstandingHowJupyterExecutes.ipynb" and read the annotations I have made to understand how to answer this.

![Task-5](/media/thm/jupyter-101/task-5.png)

After reading the document `UnderstandHowJupyterExecutes.ipynb`, we can answer the differents question.  

First, the "Cells" act like an **interpreter**. 

The In[#] value of the first Cell when it is ran for the first time would be **1**.  

The shortcut keyboard to execute a cell is **Shift + Enter**.  

If you execute again the first Cell, the value would be **2**.

# [Task 6] Interacting with the Filesystem!

> Let's log into the Instance, replacing any IP address in the pictures below with that of the Instance you have deployed.
Username: thm  
Password: tryhackme  
Port: 22

With Linux, we can login into the Instance with `ssh username@ip_machine`.

![SSH](/media/thm/jupyter-101/ssh.png)

> Now, after successful login, lets see what's going on, using ls. Then, we create a new file using touch in this case, "LookAtMe.Txt". 

![ls](/media/thm/jupyter-101/ls.png)

> Then, we create a new file using touch in this case, "LookAtMe.Txt". 

![nano](/media/thm/jupyter-101/nano.png)

> Go back to the Jupyter instance in your web browser, we can now see the file we have just created is visible within Jupyter!

# [Task 7] Handling Data With Pandas

> Navigate to the "IntroToPandas" directory on the Jupyter instance and run "IntroToPandas.ipynb" please read the annotations.

![Task 7](/media/thm/jupyter-101/task-7.png)

After reading the document `IntroToPandas.ipynb`, we can answer the different questions.  

The two main types of data within Pandas are **series and dataframes**.
The name of the Pandas function that reads a CSV file is **read_csv**.  

The function that displays the first few rows is **head**, the last few rows is **tails**.  
The functon that gives the amount of columns and rows of the dataset is **shape**.

# [Task 8] Visualising Data With Matplotlib

> Navigate to the "IntroToMatplotlib" directory on the Jupyter Instance and run "IntroToMatplotlib.ipynb" please read the annotations.

![Task 8](/media/thm/jupyter-101/task-8.png)

After reading the document `IntroToMatplotlib.ipynb`, we can answer the differents question. 

The different answers are : 
* **plot()**
* **xlabel**
* **ylabel**
* **title**
* **color**
* **zlabel**
