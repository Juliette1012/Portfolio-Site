It's a write-up about the room : [Try Hack Me - Room : Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnmap)

# [Task 1] - Deploy 

> Nmap is an incredibly valuable tool in the world of penetration testing. In this room, we will cover the basics of using Nmap to effectively scan a target, gaining insight for further attacks!

We deploy the instance.

# [Task 2] - Nmap Quiz

* First, how do you access the help menu?  
We access the help menu of nmap, we used the command : `nmap -h`. The answer is `-h`.

* Often referred to as a stealth scan, what is the first switch listed for a 'Syn Scan'?  
Stealth scan, Syn Scan : `-sS`

* Not quite as useful but how about a 'UDP Scan'? `-sU`

* What about operating system detection? `-O`

* How about service version detection? `-sV`

* Most people like to see some output to know that their scan is actually doing things, what is the verbosity flag? `-v`

* What about 'very verbose'? (A personal favorite)? `-vv`

* Sometimes saving output in a common document format can be really handy for reporting, how do we save output in xml format? `-oX`

* Aggressive scans can be nice when other scans just aren't getting the output that you want and you really don't care how 'loud' you are, what is the switch for enabling this? `-A`

* How do I set the timing to the max level, sometimes called 'Insane'? `-T5`

* What about if I want to scan a specific port? `-p`

* How about if I want to scan every port? `-p-`

* What if I want to enable using a script from the nmap scripting engine? For this, just include the first part of the switch without the specification of what script to run? `--script`

* What if I want to run all scripts out of the vulnerability category? `--script vuln`

* What switch should I include if I don't want to ping the host? `-PN`

# [Task 3] - Nmap Scanning

* Let's go ahead and start with the basics and perform a syn scan on the box provided. What will this command be without the host IP address?  

We used the command : `nmap -sS`. 

* After scanning this, how many ports do we find open under 1000?  

After scanning, we found `2` ports under 1000. 

* What communication protocol is given for these ports following the port number?

	```
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp open  ssh
	80/tcp open  http
	```

The communication protocol of these ports is `tcp`.

* Perform a service version detection scan, what is the version of the software running on port 22?  
We used the command `nmap -sV 10.10.74.15`. But we could have used `nmap -sV -p 22 10.10.74.15`.
	
	```
	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0).  
	80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu)). 
	Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel 
	```

The version of the software running on port 22 is `6.6.1p1`.

* Perform an aggressive scan, what flag isn't set under the results for port 80?  
We used the command `nmap -A 10.10.74.15`. But we could have used `nmap -A -p 80 10.10.74.15`.
The flag isn't set under the results for port 80 is `httponly`.

* Perform a script scan of vulnerabilities associated with this box, what denial of service (DOS) attack is this box susceptible to? Answer with the name for the vulnerability that is given as the section title in the scan output. A vuln scan can take a while to complete. In case you get stuck, the answer for this question has been provided in the hint, however, it's good to still run this scan and get used to using it as it can be invaluable.   
We used the command : `nmap --script vuln  10.10.74.15`.

	|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
	|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
	|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
	|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.
