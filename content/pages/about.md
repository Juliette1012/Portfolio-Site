I am a **PhD student** at ECAM Rennes and IMT Atlantique from 1 September 2021. 
I am a member of E4SE team from IRISA lab. 

In august 2021, I defended my engineering internship, entitled `Analysis of activities in a smart home using a digital twin`, conducted in IMT Atlantique at Brest. 
Therefore, I obtained my **ENIB general engineering** degree and a **research master's degree in Intelligent, Interactive and Autonomous Systems** (SIIA) co-accredited by the UBO, the IMT, the ENSTA and the ENIB. At ENIB, I specialized in interactive application design, artificial intelligence and simulation. The master allowed me to acquire or deepen my skills in AI, multi-agent systems, robotics, virtual reality in particular.

The **subject of my thesis** is: `Collective Intelligence Strategies for Efficient Autonomous Industrial Vehicles`. The objective is to make scientific contributions to increase the autonomy of autonomous industrial vehicles (AIVs) integrated into a fleet using collective intelligence strategies. In concrete terms, the aim will be to design and develop cooperative algorithms that will dynamically carry out collective geolocation of the AIVs, collective mapping of the environment of these vehicles, collective decision making for adaptation to traffic constraints, and, in an induced way, a collective reduction of the energy impact of the AIVs.

My current research interests include : *industry 4.0, multi-agent simulation, co-simulation, robotics, cooperative autonomy, and AI*.
